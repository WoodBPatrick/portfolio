    <div class="box">Welcome, I invite you to explore my website. I believe my website is easy to navigate, so you may choose what you want to explore first. You could check out my projects page. This is where you can find all of my beautifully made programing masterpieces(or at least to an extent). The programming page will be constantly updating, when I complete a project, you will find it on that page. While we’re on the subject of updating, my homepage will also be changing, growing, and overall becoming better. Don’t be surprised if the arrangement of my page changes, it will always be easy to navigate. If you are interested in getting to know the author of this page, you may visit the About Me page. This is where you’ll learn about my passion for programming, why I got into programming, what I plan on doing for my future, and my aspirations for life. You may also want to visit the Deep Thoughts page. This is where you’ll find all of my in-depth thoughts about the world around us, and the stars above. I am very interested in space, and how space works. It’s a very complex and large landscape filled with exotic, and previously thought impossible realities. </div>
