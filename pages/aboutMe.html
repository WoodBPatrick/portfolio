    <div class="box">Welcome, I invite you to explore the About Me page. The About Me page explains some details of my life. This is where you’ll learn about my passion for programming, why I got into programming, what I plan on doing for my future, and my aspirations for life. This page will likely not update as much as the homepage or the projects page, however it is susceptible to the occasional update. All my pages in fact will be updating throughout the year. My homepage will be updating to make it look better and more appealing to explore the website. The Projects page will have my completed coding masterpieces on it. You may also want to visit the Deep Thoughts page. This is where you’ll find all of my in-depth thoughts about the world around us, and the stars above. I am very interested in space, and how space works. It’s a very complex and large landscape filled with exotic, and previously thought impossible realities. I will likely talk about my interests in this field and some others. </div>
