    <div class="box">Welcome, I invite you to explore the Deep Thoughts page. This is where you will find all of my interests that I want to discuss and write about. Most likely I will discuss about space, the mcu, and a variety of other interests. This page will likely be updating every so often. This is not my first priority page, so it will not be updating very much, but it will not be neglected. All my pages in fact will be updating throughout the year. My homepage will be updating to make it look better and more appealing to explore the website. The Projects page will have my completed coding masterpieces on it. The About Me page explains who the author of this website is, and about some of my life. This is where youâ€™ll learn about my passion for programming, why I got into programming, what I plan on doing for my future, and my aspirations for life.
