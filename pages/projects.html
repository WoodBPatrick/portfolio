    <div class="box">Welcome, I invite you to explore my projects page. This is where you’ll find all of my projects I work on during 12th grade. This’ll include photoshopped images and programs programmed in a variety of languages; this page being one of my long-term projects. Once I complete a project, you will see it on this page. All my pages in fact will be updating throughout the year. My homepage will be updating to make it look better and more appealing to explore the website. The Projects page will have my completed coding masterpieces on it. The About Me page explains who the author of this website is, and about some of my life. This is where you’ll learn about my passion for programming, why I got into programming, what I plan on doing for my future, and my aspirations for life. You may also want to visit the Deep Thoughts page. This is where you’ll find all of my in-depth thoughts about the world around us, and the stars above. I am very interested in space, and how space works. It’s a very complex and large landscape filled with exotic, and previously thought impossible realities. I will likely talk about my interests in this field and some others. </div>
