    <div class="chemotaxisChallenges">The most difficult part about this project had to have been the creation of the blue dot and keeping it on the screen for a certain amount of time(two seconds in this case). Everything else was relatively simple, but I couldn't figure out how to keep this one blue dot to appear or stay on the screen. I eventually had to dive into the deep abyss of PVector's by the suggestion of Alex Morans. It suprisingly worked great, and with some Math.random methods, tiral and error, and time; I was able to get the program to work swimmingly.</div>
