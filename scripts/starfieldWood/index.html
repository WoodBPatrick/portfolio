    <div class="starChallenges">The most difficult part about this project had to have been the problem of polymorphism and the big bang class. The methods were not hard to figure out, however, the implementation of the class into the particles interface had to have been the most difficult part about the project. It required an extra method that returned the size of the ellipse, but the other particles didn't need this method. I eventually bit the bullet, and implemented this method into every class that is a particle. Everything else in the program was relatively easy to program as it was just simple math. Most of the program just required fine tuning, and did not challenge me to the extent of the problem I explained earlier.</div>
